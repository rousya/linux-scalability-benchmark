This directory contains the latest lockmeter kernel patch against the LBS
source tree and the "lockstat" command.

To patch the kernel, p_tupdate the latest LBS source, then cd to the root
of the kernel source and enter:
  cp lockmeter-lbs.diff ../../linux/linux
  cd ../../linux/linux
  applypatch -a -m lockmeter-lbs.diff
Start with an appropriate .config, then "make oldconfig" and enable the
Lockmeter config option.

Lockstat is the basic tool used to control the kernel's Lockmeter
functionality:  e.g., turning the kernel's data gathering on or off, and
retrieving that data from the kernel so that Lockstat can massage it and
produce printed reports.  See http://oss.sgi.com/projects/lockmeter for
details.

The default lockstat/Makefile only builds the basic Lockstat tool.  The
alternative lockstat/Makefile.pcp (e.g., make -f Makefile.pcp) builds both
Lockstat and the various PCP components.

Compiling Lockstat requires the kernel file "lockmeter.h", which is found in
source tree of a lockmeter-capable kernel (i.e., a kernel that has been patched
by the lockmeter patch).  The Lockstat Makefile expects that the symbol
LINUX_INC_ROOT points to such a lockmeter-capable kernel source tree.
LINUX_INC_ROOT defaults to $WORKAREA/work/linux/linux/include".
If this default is incorrect, then you must redefine the symbol as appropriate
before attempting the 'make'.
